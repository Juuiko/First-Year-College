/*  SELF ASSESSMENT
(I noticed after writing the comments that the assignment states the comments are to be added if necessary. Although I do not believe them to be necessary;
	I kept them there in case further understanding was required.)

   1. Did I use appropriate CONSTANTS instead of numbers within the code?
       Mark out of 10:   10
       There are no numbers within the body of the code.

   2. Did I use easy-to-understand, meaningful CONSTANT names?
       Mark out of 5:	  5
       Within the context of the code and formatting I believe them to be easy-to-understand and meaningful.

   3. Did I format the CONSTANT names properly (in UPPERCASE)?
       Mark out of 5:	  5
       The constants are all named in full uppercase with words separated by underscores.

   4. Did I use easy-to-understand meaningful variable names?
       Mark out of 10:	 10
       Within the context of the code the variable names are easy-to-understand and meaningful albeit rather long.

   5. Did I format the variable names properly (in lowerCamelCase)?
       Mark out of 10:	 10
       The variables are in lower camel case.

   6. Did I indent the code appropriately?
       Mark out of 10:	 10
       The code was indented to group same steps together to make the code more legible.

   7. Did I read the input correctly from the user using (an) appropriate question(s)?
       Mark out of 10:   10
       The questions were as descriptive as possible while telling the user what to do,
       what would cause an error and what to expect next.

   8. Did I compute the answer correctly for all cases?
       Mark out of 20: 	 20
       The answer was the same as on blackboard with every example given.

   9. Did I output the correct answer in the correct format (as shown in the examples)?
       Mark out of 10:   10
       The answer is in the exact same format as shown on blackboard.

   10.How well did I complete this self-assessment?
       Mark out of 10:   10
       I completed this self-assessment as objectively as possible and to the best of my abilities.

   Total Mark out of 100 (Add all the previous marks):  100
